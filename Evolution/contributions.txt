John ran all of the Evolution Algorithms experiments and wrote the Experiments sections of the final paper.

Wilson wrote the MLP and backpropagation algorithms along with the Evolution Strategy algorithm.  He wrote the algorithm and 
implementation sections of the paper and the initial hypotheses.  He contributed to the problem statement, results and algorithm behavior 
sections of the final paper.

Laura wrote the Genetic Algorithm and Differential Evolution.  She ran the MLP tests and wrote the abstract, summary 
and GA and DE sections of the paper.  She contributed to the problem statement, algorithm behavior and summary.
